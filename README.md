## About
Typist is a speech-to-text AI assistant that helps with typing and editing text in real time. It focuses on making voice typing easier, and also improves text input by adding various commands, such as "insert word", "delete", "highlight" and many others. To start using Typist, you need to wake it up using the voice command "wakeup Typist". At this stage, the assistant only supports English. In the future, support for other languages, personalization (working with personal data, template support), and interface improvements are also planned.

Typist is based on a pre-trained wav2vec2-base model, which was trained on the LibriSpeech dataset, as well as our custom dataset for domain adaptation. We are currently refining the model, and development of the basic interface will begin soon.
